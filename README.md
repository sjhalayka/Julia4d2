Direct3D / MFC / C++ code to calculate the quaternion fractal sets.

New in version 1.93 -- fixed a big time bug, but had to disable the caching system because it would not compile in Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate Edition. Use vs_ultimateweb.exe to install a trial version of Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate Edition, if need be.

I absolutely cannot seem to get it to compile and link in Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. I need a help.
